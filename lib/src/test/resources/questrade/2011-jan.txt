ESTATEMENT 7 of 9
FOR YOUR INFORMATION
Transactions this month 
Transactions are displayed in chronological order. Opening and month–end balances are also shown. Transactions that settle after the date of this statement are excluded from your positions.
Transactions that have been settled at a price that is less than one-tenth of one cent ($0.001) will be shown as having a price of $0.000 on your statement. The gross and net amounts will still show
the full value of the transaction.
Security positions 
Quantities listed as "owing by you" indicate securities which are currently due from you or which you have sold short. The "estimated market value" of an exchange listed security is obtained from
sources we believe to be reliable, but we do not guarantee the accuracy. For securities not listed on an exchange or that are traded infrequently, the value given is an estimate which does not
necessarily reflect the true market value; ("–") prints when the price is suspect. Some securities may not be priced because no data was available. "Segregated securities" are securities held in your
account either registered in your name (SFK) or in bearer form (SEG).
Any free credit balances represent funds payable on demand which although properly recorded in our books, are not segregated and may be used in the conduct of our business.
